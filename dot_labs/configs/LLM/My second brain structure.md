**Explanation**
- Im using Obsidian as my main application
- Zettels means small note, its like the connected dots
- My daily notes are grouped by folder from year->month->date
- Reference Notes are like its name for reference, but for course reference its grouped by folder C
- Canvas folder is used for storing canvas created
- My tagging system is also using subtagging
example: Interview tag but for Behavioural, would be #Interview/Behavioural, #OtherTags, #etc

**Important Note**
- Each key concept in a Zettel should be linked for better graph visualization
- Links helps track relationships and build a knowledge graph
- Reference notes should be broken down into multiple atomic Zettels
- Each Zettel should have unique key points as links
- When creating Zettels, each must be in a separate artifact
- Zettels include block references if possible (^unique-id)
- Always use hierarchical tagging system
- Place Zettels in appropriate folders based on content type
